# Beziervizer

Beziervizer is an R package for plotting interactive Bézier curves. Users can move the control points of plotted result at will and the curve will transform accordingly. There will be some functions to demonstrate the properties of Bézier curves in an interactive way.

## Installation

Install the package from GitHub as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github("ZiyanXiong/Beziervizer")
```

## Left Work
I am planning to add a function to help users generate high order Bézier curves with provided control points and a function to demonstrate the property of rational Bézier curves. Some other left works include making a vignette, completing the document, arranging current code.
